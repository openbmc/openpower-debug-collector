      "message": "what is the max size memory allocates for each chi-op requests. other reveiw i noticed primary processor 80MB and alt primary less. since the interfcae deisn\u0027t take any size parameter. memory allocation is going to be 4 proc config - 4*2*max size and also consider the more processor config systems. Need to look the impact on this memory allocation. \nGod test is that  cerate hostboot dump after step 16 ( that is time Host collects max size data) and see the any impcat is there or not.\nAlso same fsi bus is used for clock on/off path dump data collection am not sure you are really getting any performace boot here ( am not fsi expert). Considering devender\u0027s comments. am not sure processor level parlleisation really helps here until you have strong reason to implement this and solving other issues mentioned above. @devender.",
