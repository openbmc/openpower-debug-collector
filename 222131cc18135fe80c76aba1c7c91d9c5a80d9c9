To generate this we needed to have elog-gen.py.\n\nThe following code generates two files: error.hpp and error.cpp, and requires sdbus++. These are generated during build time. Are you saying we don\u0027t need these two files or simply check-in those files? Other repos do similar to what is being done here.",
