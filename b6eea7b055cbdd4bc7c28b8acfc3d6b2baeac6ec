      "message": "I\u0027ve got somewhat mixed feelings on this. It\u0027s something we did in a lot of our earlier services. It\u0027s using a mapper trick to wait for this service to appear in mapper before considering it complete. This allows other services to say \"After\u003dorg.open_power.Dump.Manager.service\" and be assured that this service is up and running AND mapper has added it to it\u0027s data structures. Not adding this puts the burden on other services to do an After on this service AND then also handle it not being in mapper yet. I\u0027d say we just keep it.",
